#+title: r2pipe.el

A way to use radare2 from emacs lisp. Eventually, this should be used in a
client like magit, but with radare2 instead of git.

* Example Usage:

  This opens a radare2 process for the file at =/usr/bin/ls= and prints the
  first 10 bytes in hexadecimal.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq r2pipe (r2open "/usr/bin/ls"))
    (r2cmd r2pipe "x 10")
  #+end_src
